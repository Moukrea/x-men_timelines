# A word on time travel logic

This explanation contains spoilers for the movies Deadpool 2, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Avengers: Endgame and Loki (the TV show), proceed to reading with caution!

Ok, so the "Branching timelines" time travel logic assumes that if you go back in time and make any kind of changes, a new timeline appears. Here's how it would go in simple fashion:

| Timeline | |
| ---- | ---- |
| A | I'm in 2018, I want to kill baby Hitler (like Deadpool attempted to do), let's go back in time! |
| - | This splits timeline **A** into timeline **B** |
| B | Here I am, 1889! |
| B | Unlike Deadpool, I manage to kill baby Hitler, bye bye World War II! Let's go back in 2018 |
| A | World War II still hapenned, wait... what? |

Actually when on timeline **B** in 1889, going (back) to 2018 brings me back on timeline **A**. That's because the past of 1889's timeline **B** is not 1888, but timeline **A**'s 2018, where timeline **B** has been created. Of course for folks living in 1889, their past is still 1888 much like on timeline **A**'s 1889 people (and **is** timeline **A**'s 1888). The past of timeline **B** in 1889 is actually timeline **A** all the way from 2018, where this timeline **B** has been created from timeline **A**.

So if instead of going back to timeline **A**'s 2018, I freeze myself up (Steve Rogers fashion) until 2018, then I can discover a much much different 2018 where World War II has never hapenned, on timeline **B**.

Then what if... from timeline **B** (no matter which year after 1889), I want to go back in 1888, right before 1889? Well, this is where it gets funky:
Timeline **B**'s 1888 doesn't exist as I stated before, going back to 1888 means going back to timeline **A**!

_This would justify Deadpool going back to 1979's Earth-10005 to kill the pale copy of himself (Weapon XI from X-Men Origins: Wolverine)._

But it gets worse... let's get a dude from timeline **B** in 1890 and assume he gets a time machine. He cannot go into timeline **B** 2017 (his future) as these events are yet to happen, but he can get to 2017... Confused?

We know timeline **B** has been splitted of 2018's timeline **A** when I get to 1889 to kill baby Hitler, so the past of timeline **B** is actually timeline **A**'s 2018!

  <summary>Case: Past (2014) Thanos and Nebula traveling (back) to the future (2023)</summary>
  
This is how Nebula and Thanos travelled (back) to the future from 2014 in Avengers: Endgame as the time travel of 2023's Hawkeye, Black Widow and Nebula created a new timeline branched of their 2023 timeline (MCU Earth-616). Nebula and Thanos actually didn't go to the future, but to the past of their timeline, which is MCU Earth-616's 2023!
  
</details>

This is obviously flawed, as going back on a previous timeline (from **B** to **A**) should actually result in a branched new timeline **C**, but we have to keep it simple for entertainment sake, it's already complicated enough!

<details>
  <summary>Case: The Avengers: Endgame issue</summary>
  
Earth-616 shouldn't be Earth-616 after Avengers: Engdame as there was lot's of back and forth in time, but we'll assume the timeline number is relative to the point of view of the people doing the actions, so we'll keep the same number. There's another flaw in Endgame, when they get back to the present... the present is **AFTER** they went back in time, which means they travelled into the future... For this, we'll assume time travelling opens a window where events are going forward for both timelines in sync for a little while.

</details>

This issue could be adressed with a sub-numbered system though:

<details>
  <summary>The Loki's (TV Show) sub-numbering system (click to reveal)</summary>
  
Loki (the TV show, not the character) mentions Earth-616 several times on screen during the show. The TVA seems to be OK with time travel as long as there's no "Nexus" event as they call it, an event where the resulting timeline is drastically different from the one they intend (their "Sacred Timeline"). But we're hinted (albeit very subtly) that there's multiple Earth-616 timeline running along, resulting of various events / time travels such as the ones from Avengers: Endgame.  
Want proof ? We can see during one of their time travels that they're actually on "Earth-616.432" timeline. We could then assume there's at least 432 alternate timelines caused by multiple events, which could partly have been erased by the TVA because they're just way too diverging from their Sacred Timeline as well as simply running alongside Earth-616!  
Avengers: Endgame events could have caused several of those, including the "going back to present" multiple alternate timelines _(however, we're hinted that going back to the exact moment we left a timeline doesn't make it branch to a new timeline in the very same movie)_.
  
</details>

Taking all of this into consideration, sub-numbered timelines would be the ones with no major changes as they can co-exist alongside and renamed timelines would be the ones with major changes (ie. Hitler being killed as a baby, Cable changing the past where Firefist doesn't go out of control killing everyone, etc...)

Now let's revisit our time travel logic exemple again:

| Timeline | |
| ---- | ---- |
| A | I'm in 2018, I want to kill baby Hitler (like Deadpool attempted to do), let's go back in time! |
| - | This splits timeline **A** into timeline **A.001** |
| A.001 | Here I am, 1889! |
| A.001 | Unlike Deadpool, I manage to kill baby Hitler, bye bye World War II! |
| - | This make the world really different, **A.001** is to be renamed **B** |
| B | Let's go back to 2018! |
| - | Going back to 2018 bring us back on timeline **A** and splits it into **A.002** as timeline **A** is the timeline where I'm gone to the past which can evolve on its own |
| A.002 | World War II still hapenned much like on timeline **A** |
| - | On timeline **A** my person doesn't exist anymore, part of its history includes me leaving it for another timeline |
| - | Timeline **A.002** has a part of its history where a guy left its timeline, then came back |
| - | Assuming we go back to the "exact" same moment on timeline **A** as the moment we left, the timeline shouldn't branch... but how could you get back to the very same moment, time is infinitely precise, which we are not. |

This is much, much more complicated so we'll cut some corners by not branching timeline going back to our present (**A** not becoming **A.002**), but this justify most of the time travel shenanigans of all Marvel creations.
