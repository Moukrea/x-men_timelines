# Connecting X-Men timelines dots before MCU

We all know that there’s two main timelines in this universe… the original one (Earth-10005), and the revised one taking place after the events of Days of Future Past (Earth-TRN414). The revised timeline never had a proper « real » reality number, and I highly doubt there will be any kind of official update on this, as this universe won’t ever get any new releases…

But we have anything we need to make it all click with all the movies up until the New Mutants, including Deadpool 1 & 2, Logan is a bit of an odd one to put aside from now.

So, here’s how I sorted the revised timeline (which is pretty much the official timeline):
-	X-Men: Days of Future Past ending
-	X-Men: Apocalypse
-	Dark Phoenix
-	Deadpool 1
-	Deadpool 2 (not originally in this timeline)
-	The New Mutants

Why did I place Deadpool 2 in this timeline while it’s stated its events are happening in Earth-41633 which is an alternate reality where Vanessa gets murdered? Well, this is where it gets interesting.

We also know Cable reality is Earth-66250 way in the future, speculated in 2068 (or something around this year, as Cable speaks about “50 years from now” and Deadpool 2 happening in 2018).

If we take in consideration the Quantum Realm time travel logic as seen in Avengers: Endgame (also as the one from DoFP, albeit it’s not physical time travel), here’s what would happen from Cable’s perspective:

| Year | Reality | |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| 2068 | Earth-66250 | The world is f*cked up, my family is dead. let’s kill Firefist in the “kill baby Hitler” fashion... |
| 2018 | ~~Earth-TRN414~~ Earth-66250 | Time for payback, let’s change the future _(splitting into Earth-41633)_ |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | New timeline resulting of my time travel, let’s hope I fix everything so this future is brighter than mine |
| ... | ... | …more on this later |

This doesn’t fix the going back to 2068 issue though, as if he goes back there (in his own timeline), the events remain unchanged, however somehow Cable decides to stick around for a while, we know he has to wait for his time machine to be fixed/recharged, but we could also speculate he has to figure out how to get forward in the 2060’s of this reality to be with his family again, or he knows his timeline is doomed anyway, and he just paved the way for a brighter future for Earth-41633’s Cable who’s not even born yet.

Our beloved Deadpool being on Earth-TRN414, that would mean Earth-TRN414 is actually Earth-66250 which could kinda make sense, if we look at the context of The New Mutants (happening after Deadpool 1 & 2), this timeline seems to go in a dark place.

With that in mind, Earth-41633 wouldn’t be the result of Vanessa getting killed, but the result of Cable’s time travel.

So, here’s how it would go from Deadpool’s perspective then:

| Year | Reality | |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| 2016 | Earth-66250 | Hello World, I’m Deadpool. Striker is an ass; I want Wolverine in my movie. |
| 2018 | Earth-66250 | Vanessa gets killed, I try to kill myself, become an X-Men trainee, meet a kid calling himself Firefist and get to jail |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | A guy from the future shows up and try to kill Russel allowing me to escape after a fight on Dubstep |
| - | *Earth-66250* | *Deadpool and Firefist are in jail, Deadpool might just die from his cancer* |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | Recruiting X-Force, most die besides Shatterstar. Save Firefist, then die. Cable travels back to save Deadpool _(splitting into "Unnumbered Alternate Reality #1")_ |
| 2018 | Unnumbered Alternate Reality #1 | Cable puts a lead coin on my chest, I get shot but don’t die. I get the time machine, let’s f*ck everything up! |
| 2018 | Earth-65250 | I save Vanessa, Firefist related stuff most definitely happen but differently _(splitting into "Unnumbered Alternate Reality #2")_, let’s go back and save Peter, he’s a cool dude |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | “Peter, go home!” _(splitting into "Unnumbered Alternate Reality #3")_! Cool, let’s clean the timeline |
| 1979 | Earth-10005 | Kill weapon XI, was that supposed to be me? Heck no! Sending my best to Wolvy _(splitting into Earth-18315)_ |
| 2009 | Earth-1218/Reality, 4th wall breaking | Kill Ryan Reynolds as he’s about to accept Green Lantern script _(splitting into "Unnumbered Alternate Reality #4")_. Now I’m bored, let’s catch up with Vanessa |
| 2018 | Unnumbered Alternate Reality #2 | Let’s make baby Cher |

Which gives us pretty much a clean slate for upcoming Deadpool movies connecting with MCU! He could come from Unnumbered Alternate Reality #2 or Earth-18315 where Weapon XI hasn’t really been a thing. I highly doubt he would come from Earth-66250, Earth-41633, Unnumbered Alternate Reality #1 or #3 as Vanessa is dead in all of these.

This would set timelines we know like this (with all events occurring in each):

| Earth-10005 | Earth-66250 | Earth-41633 | Unnumbered Alternate Reality #2 | Earth-18315 | Earth-17315 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class |
| - | Results of DoFP | Results of DoFP | Results of DoFP | - | Results of DoFP | 
| X-Men Origins: Wolverine | - | - | - | X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Weapon XI cancelled edition) | - | 
| - | X-Men: Apocalypse | X-Men: Apocalypse | X-Men: Apocalypse | **Unknown future** | X-Men: Apocalypse | 
| - | Dark Phoenix | Dark Phoenix | Dark Phoenix | | Dark Phoenix |

| - | | | | | **Unknown future** | 

There's many other way this could go, like make Deadpool set in his own reality completely detached of X-Men timeline, but I think that's not the way it was first intended (after all we've seen Beast, Quicksilver, Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Storm, and Professor X, albeit a bit too young in Deadpool 2), I might adjust this theory depending on how Deadpool gets integrated in the MCU... After all, the whole X-Men timeline remains broken with two occurence of Stryker, two Wade Wilson and many more inconsistencies.

I don't think Marvel will integrate Deadpool as a variant of the one we know like they did when they introduced Professor Xavier, Black Bolt and Reed Richards, so we'll have to wait and see, but until then, I feel like this is the right way to connect all dots

One question remains as for Logan, is this a splitted timeline completely unrelated to the revised timeline (althought it has been stated otherwise)? What event made ~~Earth-TRN414~~ Earth-66250 split into Earth-17315, where Logan takes place? There's a bit of a plot hole here but we could assume something happened in the Revised timeline (maybe Deadpool messing around ?)

The New Mutants also tried to tie with Logan with the vision of the young mutant training facility (which is the same footage we see on phone in Logan), but it could be just similar events that could have happened at different time in different timelines, after all Essex Corp is a part of both timelines (they intended to make it click, but licencing stuff made it fade away and it might be a good thing)

The whole Deadpool knows Logan is dead thing is not a problem, that's just Deadpool 4th wall breaking magic.

Here's a synthetic graph I made... yep, I'm overthinking it, but I like connecting stuff together and X-Men made it somehow challenging, so it's a good training before connecting all MCU and SSU dots which is getting way more complicated as the multiverse is now a thing!
