# X-Men timelines explained

We all know that there’s two main timelines in this universe… the original one ([Earth-10005](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-10005)), and the revised one taking place after the events of Days of Future Past ([Earth-TRN414](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-TRN414)). The revised timeline never had a proper "real" reality number, and I highly doubt there will be any kind of official update on this, as this universe won’t ever get any new releases…

But we have anything we need to make it all click with all the movies up until the New Mutants, including Deadpool 1 & 2, Logan is a bit of an odd one to put aside from now.

So, here’s how I sorted the revised timeline ([which is pretty much the official timeline](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-TRN414)):
-	X-Men: Days of Future Past ending
-	X-Men: Apocalypse
-	Dark Phoenix
-	Deadpool 1
-	Deadpool 2 (not originally in this timeline)
-	The New Mutants

Why did I place Deadpool 2 in this timeline while its events are [stated has happening on Earth-41633](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-41633) which is an alternate reality where Vanessa gets murdered? Well, this is where it gets interesting.

We also know [Cable reality is Earth-66250](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-66250) way in the future, speculated in 2068 (or something around this year, as Cable speaks about "50 years from now" and Deadpool 2 is happening in 2018).

If we take [into consideration the Quantum Realm time travel logic as seen in Avengers: Endgame (also as the one from DoFP, albeit it’s not a physical time travel)](time_travel_logic.md), here’s what would happen from Cable’s perspective:

| Year | Reality | |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| 2068 | Earth-66250 | The world is f*cked up, my family is dead. let’s kill Firefist in the “kill baby Hitler” fashion... |
| 2018 | ~~Earth-TRN414~~ Earth-66250 | Time for payback, let’s change the future _(splitting into Earth-41633)_ |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | New timeline resulting of my time travel, let’s hope I fix everything so this future is brighter than mine |
| ... | ... | …more on this later |

This doesn’t fix the going back to 2068 issue though, as if he goes back there (in his own timeline), the events remain unchanged. However Cable decides to stick around for a while, we know he has to wait for his time machine to be fixed/recharged, but we could also speculate he has to figure out how to get forward in the 2060’s of this reality. He probably knows his timeline is doomed anyway, and he just paved the way for a brighter future in Deadpool 2's resulting timeline (where Cable is not even born yet).

Our beloved Deadpool being on Earth-TRN414, Cable going back to Deadpool's time would mean Earth-TRN414 is actually Earth-66250. This could make sense, if we look at the context of The New Mutants (happening after Deadpool 1 & 2), this timeline seems to grow dark, which could lead into Cable's future.

With that in mind, Earth-41633 wouldn’t be the result of Vanessa getting killed, but the result of Cable’s time travel (which makes more sense to me).

So, here’s how it would go from Deadpool’s perspective then:

| Year | Reality | |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| 2016 |  ~~Earth-TRN414~~ Earth-66250 | Hello World, I’m Deadpool. Stryker is an ass; I want Wolverine in my movie. |
| 2018 | ~~Earth-41633~~ Earth-66250 | Vanessa gets killed. I try to kill myself, become an X-Men trainee, meet a kid calling himself Firefist and get to jail |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | A guy from the future shows up and try to kill Russel allowing me to escape after a fight on Dubstep |
| - | *Earth-66250* | *Deadpool and Firefist are in jail, Deadpool might just die from his cancer* |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | I'm recruiting X-Force, most of them die besides Shatterstar. I Save Firefist, but get shot and die. Cable travels back to save me _(splitting into "UAT #1"/"Earth-41633.001")_ |
| 2018 | UAT #1 / Earth-41633.001 | Cable puts a lead coin on my chest, I get shot but don’t die. I get the time machine, let’s f*ck everything up! |
| 2018 | Earth-65250 | I save Vanessa, Firefist related stuff most definitely happen but differently _(splitting into "UAT #2"/"Earth-41633.002")_, let’s go back and save Peter, he’s a cool dude |
| 2018 | Earth-41633 | "Peter, go home!" _(splitting into "UAT #3"/"Earth-41633.003")_! Cool, let’s clean the timeline |
| 1979 | Earth-10005 | Let's kill weapon XI, was that supposed to be me? Heck no! Sending my best to Wolfy _(splitting into Earth-18315)_ |
| 2009 | Earth-1218/Reality, 4th wall breaking | Kill Ryan Reynolds as he’s about to accept Green Lantern's script _(splitting into "UAT #4"/Earth-1218.001)_. Now I’m bored, let’s catch up with Vanessa |
| 2018 | UAT #2 / Earth-41633.002 __(*)__ | Let’s make baby Cher |

_(*) This would actually create another timeline (assumed Earth-41633.004) rather than being Earth-41633.002 but let's keep it simple_

**UAT** = Unnumbered Alternate Timeline  


Which gives us pretty much a clean slate for upcoming Deadpool movies connecting with MCU! He could come from UAT #2 or Earth-18315 where Weapon XI hasn’t really been a thing. I highly doubt he would come from Earth-66250, Earth-41633, UAT #1 or UAT #3 as Vanessa is dead in all of these.

This would set timelines we know like this (with all events occurring in each):

| Earth-10005 | Earth-66250 | Earth-41633 | UAT #2 / Earth-41633.002 | Earth-18315 | Earth-17315 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class | X-Men: First Class |
| - | Results of DoFP | Results of DoFP | Results of DoFP | - | Results of DoFP | 
| X-Men Origins: Wolverine | - | - | - | X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Weapon XI cancelled edition) | - | 
| - | X-Men: Apocalypse | X-Men: Apocalypse | X-Men: Apocalypse | **Unknown future** | X-Men: Apocalypse | 
| - | Dark Phoenix | Dark Phoenix | Dark Phoenix | | Dark Phoenix | 
| X-Men | - | - | - |  | ??? | 
| X2: X-Men United | - | - | - | | ??? |

| X-Men: Days of future past | **Unknown future** | | | | ??? | 
| **Unknown future** | | | | | Logan | 
| - | | | | | **Unknown future** | 

There's many other way this could go, like make Deadpool set in his own reality completely detached of X-Men timeline, but I think that's not the way it was first intended (after all we've seen Beast, Quicksilver, Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Storm, and Professor X, albeit way too young in Deadpool 2), I might adjust this theory depending on how Deadpool gets integrated in the MCU... After all, the whole X-Men timeline remains broken with three occurences of Stryker, two Wade Wilson and many, many more inconsistencies.

I don't think Marvel will integrate Deadpool as a variant of the one we know like they did when they introduced Professor Xavier, Black Bolt and Reed Richards, so we'll have to wait and see, but until then, I feel like this is the right way to connect all dots

One question remains as for Logan, is this a splitted timeline completely unrelated to the revised timeline (althought it has been stated otherwise)? What event made ~~Earth-TRN414~~ Earth-66250 split into Earth-17315, where Logan takes place? There's a bit of a plot hole here but we could assume something happened in the Revised timeline (maybe Deadpool messing around ?)

The New Mutants also tried to tie with Logan with the vision of the young mutant training facility (which is the same footage we see on phone in Logan), but it could be just similar events that could have happened at different time in different timelines, after all Essex Corp is a part of both timelines (they intended to make it click, but licencing stuff made it fade away and it might be a good thing)

The whole Deadpool knows Logan is dead thing is not a problem, that's just Deadpool 4th wall breaking magic.
